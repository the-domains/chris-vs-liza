  Customer Relationship Management is both an art and a science. Often
  overlooked is the clear and necessary join between state of the art technology
  systems capable of handling 1-2-1 interactions and the art of not only
  understanding who your customer is today, but understanding who your customer
  is tomorrow - and of course, what they'll need! MCCRM puts the customer front
  and centre. After all, it's their passions, interests, objectives and whims
  that are driving demand. Sure, insight driven outbound, smart sales practice
  and promotional marketing can stimulate 'pull', but if they don't need what
  you offer today, or they fell in love with another brand yesterday, or they
  realize your brand has fallen into the 'not trusted' bucket - then selling and
  promotions simply won't drive them to you.  Human beings are complex. The
  relationship they want with your brand could change in a heart-beat. Ensuring
  you're ready for that, ensuring you can respond to that, to be 'in time' when
  the change comes - that's what consulting and systems design from MCCRM
  delivers.  Call MCCRM today - let's talk about it.
