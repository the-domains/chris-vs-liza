  Stars are vanishing. The reasons why could reveal clues about alien life
  Uppsala University is researching what happens to stars that seemingly
  'disappear' By EMILY REYNOLDS Monday 4 July 2016 Credit Omar
  Almaini/University of Nottingham Man's search for extra-terrestrial life
  hasn't been particularly fruitful, so far, but a team from Uppsala University
  believes it may be able to find signs of other beings by searching for
  "vanishing" stars. By searching the sky, the team hope to see if any of the
  300,000 light sources they've surveyed have disappeared in between surveys.
  "Searches for extra-terrestrial intelligence (SETI) using large survey data
  often look for possible signatures of astroengineering," explained the
  researchers. "We propose to search for physically impossible effects caused by
  highly advanced technology, by carrying out a search for disappearing galaxies
  and Milky Way stars." READ MORE Take a trip into the depths of the Universe

  WOOLLASTON As part of their research they selected 10 million objects and
  searched for objects not found at the expected positions in the Sloan Digital
  Sky Survey (SDSS). They did this by visually examining images of 290,000
  objects with no counterpart in the SDSS. From this, the team found one star
  that had seemingly disappeared. In particular, they found one candidate of
  interest for follow-up photometry, although they added "it is very uncertain."
  The object can be seen clearly in one image, and despite being still visible
  in another, it is "very faint," suggesting its brightness has dimmed
  considerably. Examples of such "hypothetical effects", the team said, include
  a galaxy that "rapidly and strongly changes size over the course of a few
  years", a galaxy that "disappears entirely from its location", or stars that
  disappear from their location. Though this disappearance could be down to
  alien lifeforms, there could also astrophysical reasons â€“ quasars, for
  example, often dim. But the team remains hopeful. "This opens up for
  fascinating, new interpretations of our ever-changing sky," they said. SHARE
