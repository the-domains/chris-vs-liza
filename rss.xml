            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Test</h1><p>Customer Relationship Management is both an art and a science. Often overlooked is the clear and necessary join between state of the art technology systems capable of handling 1-2-1 interactions and the art of not only understanding who your customer is today, but understanding who your customer is tomorrow - and of course, what they'll need!MCCRM puts the customer front and centre. After all, it's their passions, interests, objectives and whims that are driving demand. Sure, insight driven outbound, smart sales practice and promotional marketing can stimulate 'pull', but if they don't need what you offer today, or they fell in love with another brand yesterday, or they realize your brand has fallen into the 'not trusted' bucket - then selling and promotions simply won't drive them to you. Human beings are complex. The relationship they want with your brand could change in a heart-beat. Ensuring you're ready for that, ensuring you can respond to that, to be 'in time' when the change comes - that's what consulting and systems design from MCCRM delivers. Call MCCRM today - let's talk about it.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/723b3fb6cac920351f49347c61eed41a310c393c.jpg"></article>]]></description>
